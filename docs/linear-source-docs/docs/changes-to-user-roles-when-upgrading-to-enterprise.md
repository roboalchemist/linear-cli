# Changes to user roles when upgrading to Enterprise

If your existing workspace upgrades from any other plan to the Enterprise plan:

* All current admins are automatically upgraded to workspace owners
* On Enterprise, the existing workspace admin role has more limited permissions than workspace owner.
* Regular members and guest users remain unchanged

Workspace owners can now assign users to the new [admin role](https://linear.app/docs/members-roles) as needed.

## **Migrating from admins to owners with SCIM**

If your workspace has [SCIM](https://linear.app/docs/scim) enabled and is currently managing permissions via `linear-admins`:

* The group will now control workspace owners, not admins
* All users in `linear-admins` will become owners
* The group name itself will not change automatically

If you want to start managing admins as well, you can do one of the following:

> [!NOTE]
> If you previously renamed your admins management group after first pushing `linear-admins`, keep using your current renamed group. In the steps below, we refer to `linear-admins` and `linear-owners` as the default group identifiers to make the migration easier to follow, but your existing renamed group will continue to work as the admins group it was originally linked to.

### **Option 1: Rename the admins group**

> [!NOTE]
> Only use this option if your Identity Provider supports syncing group name changes, e.g., via Okta’s _“Rename app groups to match group name in Okta”_ setting.
> 
> If your IdP does _not_ support this—or you'd prefer not to enable this setting—skip ahead to the second option.

1. Rename the `linear-admins` group to `linear-owners` in your IdP
2. Create a new `linear-admins` group and push it to Linear
3. Move users who should be admins from `linear-owners` into the new `linear-admins` group

### **Option 2: Re-link the admins group**

> [!NOTE]
> Use this option if your IdP does _not_ support syncing group name updates

1. Create a new group called `linear-owners`
2. In the Linear [security settings](https://linear.app/settings/authentication), unlink the existing `linear-admins` group
3. Move intended owners from the old `linear-admins` group into the new `linear-owners` group
4. Push both `linear-admins` and `linear-owners` groups to Linear
